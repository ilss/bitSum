            <p>
                This chapter expands on the adders shown in Chapter 14 to implement subtraction.

        <h3>Eight-Bit Adder/Subtractor (pages 180)</h3>

        <div class="narrative">
            <p>
                This first circuit is very similar to the eight-bit adder shown at the end of Chapter 14.
                However, notice that the plus sign to the left in now implemented in a button. 
                You can toggle that button between addition and subtraction.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you choose to subtract the second number from the first, an array of XOR gates 
                inverts the values of the second row of buttons (which calculates the ones’ complement), 
                and sets <b>Carry In</b> at the right to 1, which effectively forms the two’s complement.
                The two numbers are then added.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="canvas-container">
            <canvas id="canvas8BitAddSub" width="1225" height="665">

        </div>

        <div class="narrative">
            <p>
                If an addition results in a value greater than 255,
                or a subtraction results in a value less than zero, 
                this is indicated by the <b>Overflow</b> output, and the result is invalid.
                When such an adder is cascaded with other adders for a larger value, 
                that overflow might be treated as a <b>Carry</b> or a <b>Borrow</b>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Eight-Bit Two’s Complement Adder (pages 210)</h3>

        <div class="narrative">
            <p>
                The following adder is dedicated to adding a pair of eight-bit two’s complement numbers
                that range from 80h (decimal &#x2013;128) through 7Fh (decimal 127).
                The hexadecimal and decimal equivalents of the values you choose are shown at the right.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="canvas-container">
            <canvas id="canvasTwosCompAdder" width="1250" height="590">
                Your browser does not support the canvas element.
            </canvas>
        </div>

        <div class="narrative">
            <p>
                If one value is positive and the other negative, the result is always valid as indicated by an <b>Overflow</b> value of 0.
                But if the two values are positive and the sum is greater than 127, 
                or the two values are negative and the sum is less than &#x2013;128, an <b>Overflow</b> value of 1 indicates a problem.
            </p>
