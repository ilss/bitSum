                One of the most important and versatile features of any vector
                programming system is transforms. These are functions that 
                perform arithmetic operations on coordinates before they are
                used to display figures. They are generally of four kinds:
                
                - translation: shift coordinates from one place to another
                - scaling: multiply coordinates to make figures larger or smaller
                - rotation: turn coordinates around an axis
                - skewing: obliquely tilt figures

                Coding an analog clock presents the perfect opportunity to use
                transforms.
